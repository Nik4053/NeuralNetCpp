# Neural net using C++

## Compilation
Compile using the provided Makefile by calling `make`.
Choose either irisTest or mnistTest as target.
These targets can be changed by modifying the TARGET variable in the Makefile.

IrisTest will train an simple MLP on the iris flower dataset.
MnistTest will train an convolutional network on the MNIST dataset.

# Datasets
Place both datasets in the data folder.
The data folder should then contain these 4 files:
- .gitkeep
- iris.data
- mnist_test.csv
- mnist_train.csv
